# Library Management System (In Progress)

## Project Overview
This Library Management System is an ongoing project designed to facilitate the management of library operations. It aims to provide a comprehensive system for members and librarians to interact with the library's resources efficiently.

## Features

### Main Menu
- A range of options for users including member login, librarian login, and application termination.

### Member Login
- Allows users to enter their user number and password.
- Upon successful login, members can search for books, view their borrowed books, reserve books, return books, view their profile, and log out.

### Librarian Login
- Librarians log in in a similar manner to members.
- After logging in, they have access to functions such as managing members, managing the book catalog, viewing all borrowed books, tracking late returns, and logging out.

## Data Storage

### Database System
- The project intends to use the MySQL database system for managing and storing all project data.

### Database Structure
- Tables will be created in the database for books, members, loans, and other relevant entities.
- These tables will have defined relationships to enable efficient organization and querying of data.

### Database Connectivity
- The application will connect to the MySQL database using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC).

### Networking
- User authentication will be conducted over a network interface, including the verification of user credentials and management of user sessions.

## Development Tools and Technologies
- The system is being developed using Java and MySQL, with JDBC for database connectivity.

## Project Status
This project is currently in progress. Updates will be provided as development continues.
