The sun was shining on the sea, Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make The billows smooth and bright —
And this was odd, because it was The middle of the night.

The moon was shining sulkily, Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there After the day was done —
"It's very rude of him," she said, "To come and spoil the fun!"

The sea was wet as wet could be, The sands were dry as dry.
You could not see a cloud, because No cloud was in the sky:
No birds were flying overhead — There were no birds to fly.

The Walrus and the Carpenter Were walking close at hand;
They wept like anything to see Such quantities of sand:
"If this were only cleared away," They said, "it would be grand!"

"If seven maids with seven mops Swept it for half a year,
Do you suppose," the Walrus said, "That they could get it clear?"
"I doubt it," said the Carpenter, And shed a bitter tear.
